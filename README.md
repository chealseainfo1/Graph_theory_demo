## Overview

This repository demonstrates core graph theory algorithms and data structures, including:
- Graph representations (adjacency list, adjacency matrix)
- Traversal algorithms (BFS, DFS)
- Shortest path algorithms (Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford)
- Cycle detection
- Minimum spanning tree (Kruskal, Prim)
- Other graph utilities and visualizations

## Features

- Well-commented code for learning and reference
- Modular structure for easy extension
- Example input files for quick testing
- Visualization tools for graph structures (if applicable)
- Support for both directed and undirected graphs

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x (recommended)
- Optional: Jupyter Notebook for interactive demos

### Installation

Clone the repository:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/chealseainfo1/Graph_theory_demo.git
cd Graph_theory_demo
```

Install dependencies (if any):
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Run example scripts from the command line:
```sh
python src/bfs_demo.py
python src/dijkstra_demo.py
```

Or open the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks/` folder for interactive exploration.
